3.1 business model: Overview
Remove “Hospital Collection”

VendAI and 24/7 pharmacy need to swap places

VendAI Assistant: Initiates with a low-risk, pre-identification symptom triage to guide users and detect red-flag conditions. For cases that do not require professional consultation or restricted medicines, VendAI provides guideline-based, personalised recommendations directly to the user. It also displays and verbalises counselling points for GSL items. When a personalised assessment or telepharmacy consultation is needed, users undergo Singpass-based identity verification, enabling secure retrieval of medication history via EPS and access to pharmacist guidance for a consultation fee.

24/7 telepharmacy- The telepharmacy service operates continuously, enabling round-the-clock purchase of GSL and P medications and collection of POM medications from secure lockers adjacent to the vending machine. For all P and POM items, real-time pharmacist counselling is conducted via an on-screen interface to verify suitability and authorise dispensing. This ensures patients can access regulated medications safely at any time without being constrained by pharmacy operating hours.

Travel med kits - Our travel medication kits are tailored to each traveller’s destination and trip duration, providing only what is necessary for safe and convenient travel. This reduces the need to purchase multiple medications from different sources, minimises medication wastage, lowers overall costs, and ensures an appropriate and sufficient supply throughout the journey.


POM lockers - By enabling medication collection outside traditional hospital pharmacies, Vendo Pharmacy reduces waiting times, alleviates hospital pharmacy congestion, and improves convenience for patients who require repeat or chronic medications.


Quality control - Our pharmacy vending machines are governed by a comprehensive quality assurance framework to ensure medication safety, reliability, and regulatory compliance. This includes regular internal audits, strict First expiry first out (FEFO) and expiry monitoring, and immediate removal of expired or unsafe stock. Clear SOPs, full documentation, and system traceability support accountability, enable early detection of issues, and drive continuous quality improvement, ensuring patients receive safe and appropriate medications at all times.


What problems does Vendo Pharmacy solve?
Long waiting times: Vendo Pharmacy reduces waiting time and improves accessibility to medications through a secure locker–vending system. 
Limited access to medications outside of pharmacy operating hours: The 24/7 vending pharmacy located in residential areas provides round-the-clock access to essential medications, allowing patients to access essential medications anytime without having to worry about when pharmacies open and close.
Inefficient access to single medications: Located within residential areas, hence allows residents to quickly and efficiently obtain medications nearby without unnecessary travel.
Hospital pharmacy congestion: Offloads repeat-medication collection to pharmacist-controlled lockers, easing peak-hour crowding and improving hospital pharmacy workflow.
Manpower constraints in healthcare: Automates routine transactions and triage support, allowing pharmacists to focus on higher-value clinical care and complex cases.
