Expanding Our Services
More than just medication collection. 
•	In the future, we plan to introduce simple community health support features such as blood pressure monitoring kiosks, basic wellness checks, and seasonal health campaigns. These services are designed to help you stay on top of your health in a convenient and accessible way.
•	We’re also working with healthcare institutions to make repeat prescription collection even smoother, helping patients stay consistent with their medications and avoid missed refills.
•	For travellers, we aim to expand our travel health offerings with more destination-specific kits and easy-to-understand health guidance — so you can travel prepared and with peace of mind.

Smarter, Safer Technology
Technology that supports — not replaces — care.
•	We’re continuously improving VendAI to provide clearer guidance when selecting medications. This means better prompts, clearer safety alerts, and stronger encouragement to speak to a pharmacist when needed.
•	Behind the scenes, we’re strengthening our systems to reduce downtime, so machines remain reliable and available when you need them.
•	We’re also enhancing secure data handling and prescription traceability to ensure your information remains protected and responsibly managed at all times.

Growing Our Network
Bringing convenience closer to you.
•	We plan to work with more polyclinics, GP clinics, and hospitals to make prescription collection more accessible across Singapore. This means more locations where you can collect your medications easily and securely.
•	At the same time, we’re strengthening partnerships with trusted suppliers to maintain stable medication supply and fair pricing.
•	As we expand, we’ll roll out machines strategically in high-demand areas such as residential estates, transport hubs, and near hospitals — so help is always within reach.

Sustainable & Responsible Growth
Caring for your health — and the environment.
•	We are committed to reducing medication wastage by improving demand forecasting and ensuring medicines are dispensed within safe usage timelines. Where needed, we work with partners to safely dispose of unsuitable or near-expiry stock in a compliant manner.
•	Our expansion will also focus on clustered deployment and optimised refill routes to reduce unnecessary transport. Combined with energy-efficient machines, this helps lower our overall environmental footprint while keeping services reliable.


Targets: 
As we grow, our focus remains on making healthcare more accessible, reliable, and sustainable for everyone. We plan to introduce community health support features and expand our travel health bundles, while working closely with partners to reduce missed prescription pickups by at least 25%. At the same time, we are strengthening safety checks and secure prescription handling to maintain over 95% machine reliability, so you can depend on us whenever you need care. We are also committed to reducing medication wastage and improving energy efficiency — caring for both your health and the environment.
